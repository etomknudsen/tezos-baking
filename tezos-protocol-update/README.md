# Tezos systemd service protocol update

Run this script, with the approriate permissions, to update your tezos systemd
scripts from the old to the new protocol version. Make sure the `OLD_VERSION`
and `NEW_VERSION` variables are set to the correct values. If you're not
running it as root, you'll probably need to use sudo.
